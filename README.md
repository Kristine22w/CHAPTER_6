# CHAPTER_6
Using Common Widgets

In this chapter, I've explored the essential(basic) widgets that serve as the foundation for designing mobile apps. I also examined the various button types to use in different scenarios. Additionally, I have learned how to add assets to the app that am creating using AssetsBundle by specifying them in the pubspec.yaml file. I used the Image widget to display images from either the local device or a web server via a URL. I've discovered how the Icon widget enables us to display icon from the MaterialIcons font library.

I've learned that BoxDecoration class is use to alter appereance of widget. If we implemented InputDecoration, it will improve the users feedback on data entry. I've learned that there are different ways to use text fields widgets to retrieve, validate, and manipulate data. The Validating data entered in multiple text fields can be challenging, but the Form widget allows you to validate them either manually or automatically.
